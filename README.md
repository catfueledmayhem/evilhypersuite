## Features

### Built-in Macros
A comprehensive collection of useful macros with detailed tutorials for glitching in R6 and R15 games:

- **Freeze** - Temporarily freeze the Roblox process
- **Extended laugh clip** - Extended character animation clipping
- **Extended dance clip** - Dance animation exploitation
- **Buckey clip** - Advanced clipping technique
- **Speed glitch** - Movement speed manipulation
- **Spam key** - Rapid key input automation
- **Disable head collision** - Remove head hitbox collision
- **No head collision roof clip** - Clip through ceilings using head collision removal
- **Helicopter high jump** - Enhanced jumping technique
- **Full gear desync (dropping)** - Gear desynchronization exploit

All macros include comprehensive in-app explanations and tutorials.

### Network Control
- **Customizable lag switch** - Simulate network lag with configurable packet loss and ping
- **Ping increasor** - Add artificial latency to your connection

### Utility Tools
- **XML Editor** - Edit `GlobalBasicSettings` and other Roblox configuration files
- **Rejoin System** - Change FPS settings and rejoin the same server
- **Settings Persistence** - Save and restore your configurations
- **Themable UI** - Customize the interface appearance

### Custom Scripting System
Create and import your own macros using Lua scripts (`.hss` files):

- **Lua-based scripting** - Write custom automation scripts
- **Keyboard & Mouse Control** - Simulate inputs programmatically
- **Process Control** - Freeze/unfreeze Roblox process
- **Network Manipulation** - Control lag and packet loss via scripts
- **Persistent Scripts** - Scripts are saved and loaded automatically
- **Keybind Support** - Assign custom keybinds to your scripts
- **Hot Reloading** - Reload scripts without restarting the application

#### Example Script
```lua
-- @name: Jump Spam
-- @desc: Rapidly presses space bar 10 times
-- @author: Example
-- @version: 1.0
-- @keybind: F6

function onExecute()
    for i = 1, 10 do
        pressKey("Space", 50)
        sleep(50)
    end
    log("Jump spam complete!")
end
```

See the [Scripting Documentation](https://your-website.com/docs/scripting) for complete API reference and examples.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/roblox-hypersuite/releases) page
2. Extract the archive
3. Run the executable
4. (Optional) Place custom `.hss` scripts in the `scripts/` folder for automatic loading

## Platform Support

- Linux (primary)
- Windows (via MinGW cross-compilation)

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

**For Linux builds:**
- `g++` with C++17 support
- `make`
- `raylib` development libraries
- Lua 5.4 (included in `include/lua-5.4.2_linux/`)
- OpenGL development libraries
- X11 development libraries
- Optional: `ccache` for faster recompilation

Install dependencies on Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libraylib-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libx11-dev ccache
```

**For Windows cross-compilation (from Linux):**
- `x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++` (MinGW-w64 cross-compiler)
- Windows raylib libraries (included in `include/raylibWin64/`)
- Windows Lua 5.4 libraries (included in `include/lua-5.4.2_win64/`)

Install MinGW on Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install mingw-w64
```

### Build Instructions

**Build for Linux:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/3443o-o/roblox-hypersuite.git
cd roblox-hypersuite
make linux
# Output: build/linux/utility
```

**Build for Windows (cross-compile from Linux):**
```bash
make windows
# Output: build/win64/utility.exe
```

**Build both platforms:**
```bash
make all linux windows
```

**Additional build options:**
```bash
make debug          # Debug build with symbols and no optimization
make lto            # Link-time optimization for better performance
make clean          # Clean all builds
make clean-linux    # Clean Linux build only
make clean-windows  # Clean Windows build only
make info           # Show source and object files
```

### Build System Features

- Parallel compilation (uses all CPU cores)
- Automatic dependency tracking
- Incremental builds (only recompiles changed files)
- ccache support for faster recompilation
- Static linking for standalone executables

## Usage

1. Launch Roblox Hypersuite
2. Select desired macros from the list
3. Configure keybinds by right-clicking on macros
4. Enable/disable macros with right-click
5. Import custom scripts using the "+ Import script" button

## Scripting API

### Core Functions
- `pressKey(key, delay)` - Press and release a key
- `holdKey(key)` - Hold a key down
- `releaseKey(key)` - Release a held key
- `typeText(text, delay)` - Type a string
- `moveMouse(dx, dy)` - Move mouse cursor
- `sleep(ms)` - Pause execution
- `log(message)` - Print to console

### Advanced Functions

## Security Warning

**Only import scripts from trusted sources.** Custom scripts have access to:
- Keyboard and mouse simulation
- Process control (suspend/resume)
- Network manipulation

Always review script code before importing.
